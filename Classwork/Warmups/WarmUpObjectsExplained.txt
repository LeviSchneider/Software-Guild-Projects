Can an object have more than one type? Explain.

	Yes an object can have more than one type. For example, you 
	have a manager object that has specific attributes that are 
	only relevant to it, and you have his assistant who also has
	specific attributes unique only to that object, but at the 
	same time both the manager and the assistant are both 
	employees inheriting all the attributes that come with that.
    The valet of the same company also inherits the employee 
    type while having attributes specific to the type driver and
    so on. These types are connected through a "is-a
    relationship"

    Other types of relationships that describe the way object
    types relate to one another include "has-a relationship" which is describing types that are aspects of another specific type like a wheel and a bicycle, or coffee to cup.

    Then you  have types connected through a "uses-a relationship" like a bicycle type uses a tire pump type, or a manager type uses a pen type, etc.
