1: What is the difference between HTTP POST and HTTP GET?
    HTTP GET requests data from a specified resource. GET requests can also...
        be cached
        remain in browser history
        be bookmarked
        be bad when dealing with sensitive data
        have length restrictions
        should only be used to retrieve data
        
    HTTP POST submits data to a specified resource. POST requests...
        are never cached
        do not remain in browser history
        cannot be bookmarked
        have no restrictions on data length
        
2: Can both methods pass data to the server?
    Both can pass data to the server.
    
3: If so, how is that data passed to the server for each method?
    You can use angularjs to send information to with the http get and the http post methods.

4/5: Are there any other HTTP methods?
    
    HTTP GET: returns the body in the response
    
    HTTP DELETE:allows a client to remove a document or webpage from the server.
    
    HTTP PUT: allows a client to place a file on the server and is similar to sending a file by FTP.
    
    HTTP HEAD: counts the output bytes in the response to se the Content-Length header accurately.
    
    HTTP LAST MODIFIED: returns the amount of milliseconds since midnight.
    
    HTTP OPTIONS: determines which http methods the server supports and returns an appropriate header.
    
    HTTP TRACE: returns the headers sent with the trace request to the client so that they can be used in debugging.
