1)The '=' operator sets the value of the variable.

2)The '==' operator compares values asking if they are equal.

3)With primitives the operators compare to see if they are exactly vs reference operators that measure values approximately.

4)The equals() method performs like the '==' operator, but the equals method compares the value of these variables and not their location in memory.

5)The equals method can be applied to all types.

6)Yes because it defaults to the parent class that has overridden the method.
